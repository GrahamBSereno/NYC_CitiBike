## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The goal of this analysis is to use data and tactful visualization to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 
I am creating a NYC CitiBike storyboard through the use of Pandas for data transformation and Tableau for visualization.
Other key tasks are to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
