# NYC_CitiBike

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The goal of this analysis is to use data and tactful visualization to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 
I am creating an NYC CitiBike storyboard through the use of Pandas for data transformation and Tableau for visualization.
Other key tasks are to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

### Checkout Times By Gender
Description: This demonstrates the length of time for rides in minutes based on gender. As you can see, gender is not necessarily a key indicator regarding the length of rides.

### Trips By Weekday
Description: This is a heatmap showing the distribution of ride count across weekdays and times of the day. Mornings (7am to 9am) and evenings (5pm to 7pm) seem to be capturing a higher frequency across weekdays due to commuters to work. On weekends, afternoons tend to be more popular.

### Trips By Gender
Description: This is a heatmap showing the distribution of ride count across weekdays and times of the day with a gender split added. CitiBike seems to be much more popular with those who identify as male gender.

## Summary of Results
Results are provided in line with each visual description; but the general theme is that males tend to take more CitiBike rides. The Lower Manhatten, Times Square, and Central Park areas are trafficked the heaviest. Subscribers have much higher ride counts.

## Additional Visualization Suggestions
